# Walmart_Stock_Analysis


## Data Set 

For this project, I utilized the "Walmart Stocks Dataset (2000 - 2024)" available on Kaggle. The dataset includes:


- Date - The date
- Open - The opening value
- High - The highest value
- Low - The lowest value
- Close - The closing value
- Adj Close - The adjusted closing value
- Volume - The trading volume of the stocks


## About the Project
This project begins with an in-depth analysis of Walmart's stock history and trading patterns. By examining seasonal and monthly trends in closing prices, I explored the correlations between various features to understand their impact on the closing prices, which is the focal point of this analysis.

Following a thorough "Exploratory Data Analysis" (EDA), I developed a Linear Regression model aimed at predicting the closing prices based on the opening prices, leveraging insights gained from the data.
